          <p>The visual hierarchy principle is perfectly identified here in the main page of Google Cloud providers, we can see how they are calling your attemption using a nice font with a big size in the main part, perhaps this is not the only way as they are using a nice blue color in a button that will send you into the main tool that they are offering. This is not only about sizes but even colors could be used.</p>
